# Java-FX-based-Address-Book-GUI
Contact Address Book GUI using Java FX
•	This project would mainly focus on creating a simple contacts application using JavaFX that has a single main window. 
•	The application will allow the user to add a contact, edit a contact, and delete a contact. 
•	The contacts would be displayed using the TableView control.
•	There will be a ContactData class, which would provide a way to load and store contacts using XML.
•	Moreover, in addition to the ContactData class, a contact class would be needed to store individual contacts. 
•	For each contact, first name, last name, phone numbers, and notes would be stored.
•	The contact information might be stored in certain string fields.
•	To get data binding to work with the TableView, the contact information would be stored as SimpleStringProperty fields.
•	Application class would be inherited to the Main class.
